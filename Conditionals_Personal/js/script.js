//This is where I am going to do my Ternary Operator for the requirements of this assignment

//First I need to remind myself of the structure of a Ternary (condition) ? do if true : do if false

// I would like to finish my homework. It has been a really heartbreaking week and I need some help with my focus. I will reward
// myself if I complete my homework.

//I will create my statement in English
// (If get my homework done before 5pm) ? I will take my husband out for dinner : I will not be able to go out to dinner;

// I will create my givin:

//I will have to create a prompt in order to ask for the time of completion
var time;
//I will have to create a boolean for if my homework is completed
var homework;

//this is my attempt at the ternary. I referred to line 9 for structure and line 15 for content.
(homework === "true" && time <= 1700) ? alert("Good job. Take your man out for dinner!") : alert("It looks like you get ramen noodles tonight.");
