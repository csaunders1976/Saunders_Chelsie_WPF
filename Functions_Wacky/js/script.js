//Naughty Tribbles

/* I originally had breeding bunnies. I figured that I had to consider that a large portion
of rabbits were born male. I was not sure I could calculate that. Fortunatly I am a Star Trek Fan
and remembered that Tribbles are asexual and born pregnant. That would certainly make things
easier to calculate.R.I.P Gene Roddenberry*/


//Givens
// How many hours lapsed
// how many starting Tribbles

// Tribbles can produce up to 10 offspring every 12 hours.
// I will have to multiply the starting amount of tribbles by 10 plus the original amount of tribbles.
// Rather than multiplying by ten I am going to use Math.round 1 - ten to consider tribble mortality
// Then I will have to multiply that number every 12 hours.
